   I am a (full) professor at the [Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ICT, CAS)](http://www.ict.ac.cn), where I lead the [Network Architecture and System Group](https://zhenyulee.github.io/group/). I am also an adjunct professor at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, where I teach "Advanced Computer Networks" for graduate students. I previously worked at CMU and NICTA (Australia) as a visiting faculty/researcher. I received my PhD from ICT, CAS in 2009, and my BS from Nankai University in 2003. 

   My main research interest is data-driven networking --- designing network protocols, algorithms and systems with the insights from large-scale measurements and analysis. My research has led to publications at a range of top conferences (e.g., SIGCOMM, NSDI, EuroSys, ATC, CoNext, IMC, ICNP, INFOCOM, WWW) and journals (e.g. IEEE/ACM ToN, IEEE TPDS, IEEE TMC). I am very proud that some of my research has been deployed in Internet-scale systems serving hundreds of millions of users. I was selected as a Distinguished Young Scholar by Beijing NSF in 2020 and an Excellent Member of the Youth Innovation Promotion Association, CAS in 2017.
