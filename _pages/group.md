I have been leading the Network Architecture and System Group at ICT, CAS since June, 2019. The group was previously led by Prof. Gaogang Xie. Our group focuses on: (1) Internet measurement; (2) Internet architecture and (3) programmable network. We are more system oriented --- we observe networked systems, optimizing them and also build new ones. 

We work closely with industry partners. If you are from industry and are interested in collabrating with us, please do not hensitate to contact me. We are also always looking for highly motivated students that are interested in system developing as either interns or post graduate students. Please drop me emails if you are interested.

Below I list those students that had closely worked with me or are now working with me.
