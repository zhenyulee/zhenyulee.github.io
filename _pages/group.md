I have been leading the Network Architecture and System Group at ICT, CAS since June, 2019. The group was previously led by [Prof. Gaogang Xie] (https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~\_xie). Our group focuses on: (1) Internet measurement; (2) Internet architecture and (3) programmable network. We are more system oriented --- we observe networked systems, optimizing them and also build new ones. 

We work closely with <span style="color:blue">industry partners</span>. If you are from industry and are interested in collabrating with us, please do not hensitate to contact me. 

We are also always looking for <span style="color:blue">highly motivated students</span> that are interested in system developing as either interns or post graduate students. Please drop me emails if you are interested.

Below I list the PhD students that had closely worked with me or are now working with me.
